Using IEX Cloud API
-Sandbox mode
--gives randomised financial data
--allows you to check whether api calls are working before you use   the real API and incur data usage charges
-secrets.py contains tokens and passwords. Should be included in gitignore so this file does not get pushed to git for people to see.
-need an endpoint that has market cap and price
-endpoint is just a url extension
--endpoints are the final information you need
--i.e. google maps coord gives location only, but another endpoint would give population 
-can look up parameters in the json by searching on iex webside
